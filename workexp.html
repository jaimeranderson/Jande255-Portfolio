In front of house, I maintained a friendly environment with the customers, organized uber eats deliveries, managed the cookies coming in and out of the oven, and filled the board. In the back of house, I collaborated with the other bakers to ensure we had a steady supply of varying cookie flavours being prepared in a timely manner.</div>
