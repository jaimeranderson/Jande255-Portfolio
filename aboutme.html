        <h1>About Me!</h1>
        <h2>Education/ Professional</h2>
        <p2>I am currently in my second year studying software engineering at Western University! I have loved every programming course I've taken and have known this is the degree I wanted to pursue since highschool! My goal in the future is to work at a job that combines finance and software. </p2>

        <h3>Hobbies and Interests</h2>
        <p2>As well as coding, I have always loved sports and music! I did competitive dance and hockey growing up, but unfortunately had to quit in grade twelve due to injuries, otherwise I'd still be playing! I play guitar and enjoy all genres of music, and I almost always listening to music. I love spending time with friends, family, and my dog! I am always at my most calm when I'm hiking on vacation. </p2>
